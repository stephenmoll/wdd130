    <h2>Steve</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, I'm Stephen. I'm from Cape Town, South Africa. I am a single parent of two boys. My hobbies are biology, zoology, physics, and other sciences. 
    <P>To add to my hobbies, I also enjoy hiking and being in nature. I have a particular interest in reptiles, and keep many types which I use in giving educational talks to the public... I enjoy sharing my passion with others.</p></P>    
    <p>I have a degree in biochemistry and microbiology, but have never really used this degree. I am also currently studying zoology, and also software and web development</p>
    <p>My plan is to work towards one day becoming a Zoology lecturer and researcher, and to also work in software development.</p>
