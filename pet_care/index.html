                    With over 470 million dogs kept as pets worldwide alone, pets bring joy to millions of lives around the world. As many as 4 out of 5 exotic pets will die due to improper care. Exotic pets are particularly prone to having poor care since many people buy them without any knowledge about them. To add to this, many exotic pets have very particular care. Although, in many cases, this care can be easily provided in captivity, it is common for many first-time owners to be ignorant of just how much they don’t know. This often means mistakes on the part of an otherwise well-meaning owner. It is our duty to ensure the well-being of these animals.

                        Some Interesting Pet Facts
                    </h2>
                    <p class = "facts">
                        In the United States alone there are an estimated 7,538,000 pet birds, 76,811,305 pet dogs, 58,385,725 pet cats, 1,150,000 pet snakes, and 1,914,394 pet horses. On a global scale, it is hard to know the total number of pets living at any particular moment. Pets were especially helpful for people living alone. In addition, people with pets made social connections with strangers out in public and were more likely to have positive interactions with family and friends. Psychologists have shown that children who grow up with pets are more empathetic than those who have grown up in pet-less households. Some of the benefits of owning a pet are indirect; They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship.
