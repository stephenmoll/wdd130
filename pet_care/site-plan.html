        The purpose of the site is to supply easy access to up-to-date pet-care information. This will include caresheets for a variety of animals and links to useful online resources. This website makes finding the correct pet-care information easy. All resources are arranged alphabetically for ease of navigation. This site will allow for pet owners to locate specific caresheets and dedicated webpages, for their pets, whether exotic, or common. 
Pet care-sheets are useful summaries of a particular pet’s needed care. This includes information on, but is not limited to; diet, housing, grooming, common problems, breeding, and general pet well-being.
This website will help prevent incorrect pet-care. It will allow spur of the moment pet buyers to quickly educate themselves, allow children to find information on their new pets, and allow experienced pet owners to find useful information with ease. The site is laid out simply in order to be useful to a pet owner of any age. Users will use this site due to the convenience of having all the resources in one place. 
With over 470 million dogs kept as pets worldwide alone, pets bring joy to millions of lives around the world. It is our duty to ensure the well-being of these animals. 
In the United States alone there are an estimated 7,538,000 pet birds, 76,811,305 pet dogs, 58,385,725 pet cats, 1,150,000 pet snakes, and 1,914,394 pet horses.  On a global scale, it is hard to know the total number of pets living at any particular moment. 
Pets were especially helpful for people living alone. In addition, people with pets made social connections with strangers out in public and were more likely to have positive interactions with family and friends. Psychologists have shown that children who grow up with pets are more empathetic than those who have grown up in pet-less households. Some of the benefits of owning a pet are indirect; They can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship.
As many as 4 out of 5 exotic pets will die due to improper care. Exotic pets are particularly prone to having poor care since many people buy them without any knowledge about them. To add to this, many exotic pets have very particular care. Although, in many cases, this care can be easily provided in captivity, it is common for many first-time owners to be ignorant of just how much they don’t know. This often means mistakes on the part of an otherwise well-meaning owner.

      <h3>Veterinary Resources</h3>
      <p>
        It is also important to have up to date veterinary information and links to helpful vet care sources. The page with veterinary care will be aimed primarily at more advanced pet owners, vets, and zoo-keepers. That been said, it will also provide links to resources for the general public to aim them in the right direction.
        The veterinary care section will include drug and dose charts, and recommended treatments for particular diseases. 
        The veterinary section will be split into two categories; exotic, and regular.
