                <h1>What is your gear like?</h1>
                <p>We believe in style points. If you look good, you raft good, right? This is why our gear is not only new, but top of the line. Why give you a helmet, PFD (personal floatation device), wet-suit, or splash top that we wouldn't choose ourselves..? That's just silly.</p>

                </div>
                <h1>Can I bring my own gear?</h1>
                <p>Most helmets and home PFD's do not fit our stringent regualations for safety. If you have questions about specific pieces of whitewater specific apparel, please contact (see contact page).</p>
                <h1>Will I fall out of the raft?</h1>
                <p>Will you get wet? Yes. Will you fall out? Potentially. Will you swim all the way to the ocean? No.</p>
                
                <section>In the event that you do fall out of the raft, our highly experienced guides will direct you to the safest path and get you back in the boat rapidly. On class 4/5 river trips we have safety kayakers which act as swim coaches and additional rescue resources. At the minimum, our guides are trained in Advanced First Aid, Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation and Swift Water Rescue.
